My Own Real Sketch (MORSke)

Version 0.08
An active buzzer (pin 11) has been added. This makes it so that the message can be heard, as it was the original purpose of morse code in the first place ()^_^

Version 0.07
The tranlsate_toMorse() function has been put in a separate file. This makes the code easier.

Version 0.06
Added a string concatenation so that a blank space isn't needed at the end of the message anymore. Also, the output speed was increased!

Version 0.05
Included a character array. This eliminates the need of calculating the message's length and allows to use capital letters as the message is converted to lowercase!

Version 0.04
A dictionary is included as a library to fully translate a message!

Version 0.03
A simple function is used to translate vowels to morse code.

Version 0.02
Learned to use a for loop. This way, every character of a message can be translated. Next version will try to learn how to use functions!

Version 0.01
To this point I've just bought an Elegoo Arduino board. I'm learning the basics! I used this sketch to learn how to declare, define and print variables, which will be useful when actually translating every character in a message to morse code.
